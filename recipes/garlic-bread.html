            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons dried italian herbs</li>

    <strong>Instructions</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Cookie Sheet</strong> - Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside</li>
            <li><strong>Slice Bread</strong> - Slice the baguette in half lengthwise and then cut each half into three pieces. Place the cut pieces of bread on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>

            <li><strong>Butter the Bread</strong> - Generously spead the garlic and herb butter on the sliced pieces of baguette. Optional - sprinkle the top with Parmesean cheese.</li>
